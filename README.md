# Neural Network Classifier using Nearest Neighbor Partitioning

In this project, I have implemented an improvised version of a Neural Network Classifier using the concept of Nearest Neighbor Partitioning. 

Generally in the case of Neural Network Classifiers, we have that the positions of the centroids are fixed before training. However this approach limits our search for the best neural network during optimisation. 

The quality of a NN Classifier is dependent on the boundaries that exist between the classes; the clearer the boundaries, the better the classifier. 
In the case of a normal NN Classifier, we get spherical boundaries. However, the Nearest Neighbor Partitioning method gives us flexibility in making the boundaries, enabling us to find potential neural networks that have arbitrarily shaped boundaries in the partition space.
